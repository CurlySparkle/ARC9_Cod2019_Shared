# [ARC9] Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Shared
All of the attachments stuff for the [[ARC9] Call of Duty: Modern Warfare](https://github.com/CurlySparkle/ARC9-COD2019) pack will be here as its own separate pack for less space usage. 

You can add your own or even add the rest of it (since probably not all the attachments for most of the weapons will be added in; this is just an example of how it works) by making a PR (Pull Request) that could be accepted.

## ðŸ”½ Required Items
 - [ARC9](https://github.com/HaodongMo/ARC-9) (which needs to be installed in order to make this pack work and serves as the main weapon base)
 - [[ARC9] Call of Duty: Modern Warfare](https://github.com/CurlySparkle/ARC9-COD2019) (must install, serves as the main weapon pack)
