# ARC9_Cod2019_Shared
All of the attachment stuff for the ARC9-COD2019 swep pack will be here as its own separated pack for less space usage, you can add your own or even add the rest of it (since probably not all of the attachments that the weapons have wil be added in, this is just an example of how they can work so you can do your owns) as a pull request and should be accepted
